# üí´ About Me:
Hello! üëãüèº I'm Tony, a passionate Software Engineer specializing in Hexagonal Architecture, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Kotlin/Java.</br> Currently, I contribute to innovative projects at Adevinta, where I lead the implementation of solutions using technologies such as Spring, Gradle, and various databases, including PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL, among others.
